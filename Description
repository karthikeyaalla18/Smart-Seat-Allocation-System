Managing seat allocation for examinations is a critical task that requires accuracy and efficiency. Seat allotment is often a time-consuming process and can also lead to improper
student distribution. This project introduces a Smart Seat Allocation System that automates the process of assigning students to classrooms based on their roll numbers. This
system efficiently distributes the students across the available rooms, also considering some factors like seating capacity. This system efficiently distributes the students
across the available rooms, also considering some factors like seating capacity. This system reduces the administrative workload and minimizes errors. It places the students in a
way that prevents Assembling, maintains discipline, and reduces the risk of malpractice. The proposed system is ideal for educational institutions conducting Large-scale
exams, ensuring a hassle-free, transparent and well-organized seating arrangement. This project not only improves efficiency but also fosters a structured and fair
examination environment.
• Conducting large-scale examinations in educational institutions requires a well-organized seating arrangement to ensure fairness, discipline, and efficiency. Traditionally,
seat allotment is managed manually, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to improper studentdistribution. To address these challenges, our project
introduces a Smart Seat Allocation System, a web-based solution that automates the process of assigning students to classrooms based on their roll numbers.The system
effectively utilizes available classroom capacity while ensuring that students are placed strategically to minimize crowding, maintain discipline, and reduce the risk of
malpractice. By eliminating manual errors, the system reduces the administrative workload, making the entire examination process more efficient.
